Auto Job Applier (No Login, No LinkedIn)
Create a fully free web-based tool like LazyApply that lets users input job links from company websites (e.g., Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, etc.), and then automatically applies to those jobs by visiting the site, filling out the form with user-provided info (resume, name, email, etc.), and submitting it — all without login, without LinkedIn, and with a simple clean UI.

🧠 Core Functionalities:
1. 🔗 Paste Job Link & Auto-Detect Platform
User pastes job link (e.g., https://boards.greenhouse.io/companyX/jobs/12345)

The tool detects platform type (Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, etc.)

2. ✍️ Auto Form Filling via Headless Browser
Use Playwright (recommended) or Puppeteer in backend

Automatically:

Open the job link

Find form fields: name, email, phone, resume upload, etc.

Fill using user's stored data

Upload files (resume & optional cover letter)

Submit application

3. ⚙️ Profile Setup (No Login Needed)
Local-only form on frontend to let user enter:

Name

Email

Phone number

Resume file upload

Cover letter (optional)

Store all profile data in localStorage only (no DB or auth)

4. 🧾 Application Logger (Local History)
Keep a list of previously applied jobs (with timestamps & statuses)

Store in localStorage

Show status: ✅ Applied, ❌ Failed, or ⚠️ Needs Review

5. 🖼️ Simple UI with Drag-and-Drop Feel
Clean homepage:

"Paste job link" input

User info section

Upload resume/cover letter

"Apply Now" button

Application history panel below

Use Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion for a modern feel

🚫 What to Exclude:
❌ No LinkedIn automation

❌ No sign-up / login / user auth

❌ No third-party resume parsing

❌ No backend database — keep everything local unless required
